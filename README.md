## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `/hardware` ‚Äì Schematics, PCB layout (KiCad), BOM, and Gerbers
- `/firmware` ‚Äì Configuration files for VESC firmware compatibility (WIP)
- `/docs` ‚Äì Additional notes, board assembly info, and future test logs

---

## üß™ Goals

- Explore high-voltage ESC design with open documentation
- Keep the design compact while pushing thermal and electrical limits
- Provide a foundation for collaborative experimentation and learning

---

## üì• Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LJBoxx/Baguette-esc.git
   cd Baguette-esc
   ```

2. **Review the Design Files**
   - Hardware located in `/hardware`
   - Firmware is not yet customized; expected to work with stock VESC firmware (further testing required)

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Before Building**
   - This design is **completely untested**
   Electrical, thermal, and functional characteristics are unverified
   - Proceed only if you're comfortable debugging hardware issues
